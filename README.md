# GreenFoot
This is an app that will help people to reduce their carbon footprint by completing mission to earn stars.

## Audience
Anyone who wishes to reduce their carbon footprint in a fun way can use this app.

## Experience
A user opens the app and sees a login/sign up screen. If they are a new user, then they take a survey to calculate their carbon footprint. Once they finish or if they login sucessfully, then they go to a screen where it shows them their "missions" (things that they can do to score points). They can click on a "complete" button, which removes the mission from the list and gives them stars. Via a tab bar controller, they can go to a "profiles" screen that shows them how many stars that they have and their current carbon footprint.
